# Contract

This is simple code used to explain the require,assert and revert statements.


## Description

This Solidity smart contract named errors has three functions: Require(), Revert(), and Assert(). The Require() function uses the `require()` statement to check if the value of `z` is greater than zero. If it is not, the function throws an error. The Revert() function checks if the sum of `x1` and `y1` is greater than 10. If it is not, the function throws an error. Finally, the Assert() function uses the `assert()` statement to check if `n` is greater than zero. If it is not, the function throws an error.


## Requirements

To use this contract, you will need a Solidity development environment, such as Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat. You will also need a test network or a local blockchain to deploy and test the contract.
## Usage

To use this contract, follow these steps:

1)Open the Solidity development environment of your choice and create a new file.

2)Copy and paste the contents of Contract.sol into your file.

3)Compile the contract to check for any errors or warnings.

4)Deploy the contract to a test network or a local blockchain.

5)Call the setValue function with a uint256 value as an argument.

6)Check that the value variable has been set correctly by reading its value.
