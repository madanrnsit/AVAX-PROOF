# Contract

This is simple code used to explain the require,assert and revert statements.


## Description

This Solidity smart contract named errors contains three functions, Require(), Revert(), and Assert(). Require() uses the require() statement to check if the value of _z is greater than zero, otherwise it throws an error. Revert() checks if the sum of x and y is greater than 10, otherwise it throws an error. Assert() uses the assert() statement to check if n is greater than zero, otherwise it throws an error.
 

## Requirements

To use this contract, you will need a Solidity development environment, such as Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat. You will also need a test network or a local blockchain to deploy and test the contract.
## Usage

To use this contract, follow these steps:

1)Open the Solidity development environment of your choice and create a new file.

2)Copy and paste the contents of Contract.sol into your file.

3)Compile the contract to check for any errors or warnings.

4)Deploy the contract to a test network or a local blockchain.

5)Call the setValue function with a uint256 value as an argument.

6)Check that the value variable has been set correctly by reading its value.
